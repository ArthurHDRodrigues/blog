## Docker

In my last post I commented that I was working on updating Guix's Docker package to version v28.
I got the build phase to succeed, but failed in the check phase due to a new unit test that was introduced.

I got tired trying to make this test succeed or to avoid this test a all.
So I decided to share my work on the [related issue](https://issues.guix.gnu.org/74746)
and focus my energy on lower hanging fruits to clear my mind.

## Patches

After getting my Go library denied 
I decided to update an existing package

It is easy to find packages to update using the `guix refresh <package>`.
