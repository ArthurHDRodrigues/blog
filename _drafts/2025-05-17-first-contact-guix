# First contributions to Guix System

Guix System is a fairly new GNU System or GNU/Linux distribution,
the pure GNU version ships with the [Hurd kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Hurd),
while the Linux version ships with [linux-libre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux-libre)
a linux fork with all of the binary blobs, obfuscated code and portions of code under proprietary licenses removed.

It is the GNU implementation of [the pure functional deployment model](https://edolstra.github.io/pubs/phd-thesis.pdf),
inaugurated by Nix and NixOS.

As I can see, Guix cares much more about reprodutibility than NixOS and it has a dedicated HPC team.
But since it is less mature, it is kind of rough around the edges, so I decided to contribute to it!

Before submiting the patch I checked if

## Current Plan

Now I'm updating the Docker package, the current package is version [20.10.27](https://packages.guix.gnu.org/packages/docker/20.10.27/).
It is two years old.

Configure a default wallpaper Gnome doesn't have a wallpaper configured out of the box.
