## TL;DR

I got my first two accepted patches:
* Update httpd: [78570](https://issues.guix.gnu.org/78570) as [9f33cb8825](https://codeberg.org/guix/guix/commit/9f33cb88252f628899c1e11f8b72b9f0022804e1)
* Update dropbear: [78600](https://issues.guix.gnu.org/78600) as [ac88ea15c7](https://codeberg.org/guix/guix/commit/ac88ea15c74e918d3a5ad9c5e45f3ef2af2c2d20)

Total accepted patches: 2

## Docker

In my [last post](../05/17/first-contact-guix.html) I commented that I was working on updating Guix's Docker package to version v28.
I got the build phase to succeed, but failed in the check phase due to a new unit test that was introduced.

I got tired trying to make this test succeed or to avoid this test a all.
So I decided to share my work on the [related issue](https://issues.guix.gnu.org/74746)
and focus my energy on lower hanging fruits to clear my mind.

## Patches

As a low hanging fruit, I decided to update an existing package, it is a very simple thing to do, you just need to:
1. Update the `version`field in the recipe;
2. Update the tarball sha256 hash;
3. Check if the recipe still build the package;
4. Fix any problem that arises.

In Docker's case, the last packaged version is two years old.
So there are a lot more tests to patch in the recipe.
So step 4 needs a lot of work.

We can find packages that need to be updated using the `guix refresh` command.
Just be aware that it takes some time, because it fetches a lot of metadata from the internet.

```{bash}
$ guix refresh
nongnu/packages/wine.scm:25:13: winetricks would be upgraded from 20230212 to 20250102
nongnu/packages/wine.scm:145:13: dxvk would be upgraded from 2.0 to 2.6.1
nongnu/packages/wasm.scm:109:4: wasm32-wasi-clang would be upgraded from 15.0.7 to 20.1.6
nongnu/packages/wasm.scm:129:13: wasm32-wasi-libcxx would be upgraded from 15.0.7 to 20.1.6
nongnu/packages/vpn.scm:15:13: zerotier would be upgraded from 1.12.2 to 1.14.2
nongnu/packages/video.scm:84:13: intel-media-driver would be upgraded from 25.1.4 to 2018Q2.1
nongnu/packages/video.scm:119:2: intel-media-driver-nonfree would be upgraded from 25.1.4 to 2018Q2.1
nongnu/packages/video.scm:211:2: obs-with-cef would be upgraded from 30.1.2 to 31.0.3
nongnu/packages/video.scm:26:13: ffmpeg-nvenc would be upgraded from 6.1.2 to 7.1.1
```

After looking at my options, I choosed to update httpd (Apache), because the last packaged version was reasonably recent, 
so I guessed that step 4 wouldn't need any work and I was right, I just updated the version and sha256 and the build recipe was successful.
The patch is simple and was submited as issue [78570](https://issues.guix.gnu.org/78570).
**A commiter reviewed and accepted my patch!** and commited as commit [9f33cb8825](https://codeberg.org/guix/guix/commit/9f33cb88252f628899c1e11f8b72b9f0022804e1), this is **my first accepted patch**. 
But there was a problem, I was credited as *"arthurhdrodrigues--- via Guix-patches via"* instead of Arthur Rodrigues or just arthurhdrodrigues.

I have some theories about this:
* I didn't configured a name in my email; and
* I didn't use `git send-email` to submit the patches, I just copy-and-pasted the patch as in a plain text email.
  So some meta-data differed, to be precise the `Cc:` field in the email header using `git send-email` was set to my email, as shown below.

After fixing these problems, I submited [another patch](https://issues.guix.gnu.org/78600) that updates dropbear, a lightweight ssh server.
This second patch was also accepted and commited as [ac88ea15c7](https://codeberg.org/guix/guix/commit/ac88ea15c74e918d3a5ad9c5e45f3ef2af2c2d20) and this time I was credited correctly!

Now I'm ready to update more packages and go back to work with Docker v28 :D
